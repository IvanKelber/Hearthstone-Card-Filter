A super simple Hearthstone card filter made with ReactJS for my UI/UX course.  The only cards that are filtered as of now are the Basic cards, including hero portrait cards.  

To use:
- Selecting one of the radio buttons will show all cards of that type.
- Selecting one of the mana values will show all cards of that mana value.
- Clicking on any card will replace it's portrait with it's golden portrait.

As of now the filters do not overlap.  That is, selecting "Minions" and 4 mana will not result in all 4 mana minions.  Instead it will show whichever filter was selected second.  This is obviously less than ideal, and may be addressed in the future.
